# Numberline
Source Code: [/src/families/_2d/tests/numberline/](../../../../src/families/_2d/tests/numberline/)

The MakeNumberline() function makes a numberline image from the samples you give it, and writes it to disk as a png, with the specified filename.

The first sample is red and the last sample is green. This lets you see the order of the samples on the numberline.

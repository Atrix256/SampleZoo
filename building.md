# Building

This project uses premake 5, downloaded from https://premake.github.io/.

To create the solution in windows, open a command prompt in the main folder and run: ./premake5.exe vs2017

Note that this creates a solution for visual studio 2017, but other targets are supported.  See this page for more information: https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Using-Premake

Once the solution is created, open it up and compile / run as normal.

# Contributing a Sequence or Test

Most people who want to contribute code to this project are going to want to contribute either a sampling sequence, or a test of sampling sequences.

This page is a step by step guide on how to do just that.  The process is meant to be as simple as possible to help contributors, but has a side effect of isolating these chunks of code into their own areas, making it easier for readers to find and pilfer exactly what they want as quickly as possible.

The boilerplate code that interfaces with your sequence or test is auto generated to aid in this process.

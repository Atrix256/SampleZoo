# TODOs

A list of things the project needs

## Infrastructure

* premake or similar for setting up projects
* make some 1d samples and some 1d sampling tests
* make a standard for how to add new samples or tests, fill it out in the contributing file.
* do 2d, 3d, and beyond
* gather your list of sampling patterns, tests, etc on this page
* Get an FFT library (FFTW?)
* stb image for reading / writing images?
* clang tidy for style guidelines? Or google C++ style guide?

## Sampling Patterns
* 1d basic LDS
* 2d basic LDS
* Blue noise in 1d and 2d
* 1d and 2d jittered grid
* 1d golden ratio
* Martin's R2 sequence for 2d (and higher dimensions)

## Sampling Tests
* 1d discrepancy calculation
* need other 1d tests and FFT!

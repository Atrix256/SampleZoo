# Contributing

I'm currently fleshing things out and will soon have a standardized process for submitting sampling patterns and sampling tests.

Please check back later!

## Source Code Header (Strongly Suggested)

It's strongly suggested that all files submitted have a header like the below.  All fields are optional however and there are no specific rules about date format, order of fields, or similar.

If you make a change to a file, feel free to add your name to the contributors section, regardless of the size of the change.

Note that you can note what license a file is under as part of this header.  If no license information is supplied, the file will fall under the default license of this repo, which is the [MIT License](lincense.md).

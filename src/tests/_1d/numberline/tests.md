The MakeNumberline() function makes a numberline image from the samples you give it, and writes it to disk as a png, with the specified filename.

Here is an example numberline of 16 samples made with Samples::_1d::Regular::RegularCenteredOffset()

![16 samples Regular](../../../../output/samples/_1d/regular/regularcenteredoffset.png)

## Samples

### _1d

[Blue Noise](output/samples/_1d/blue_noise/page.md) - Randomized sequences that have only high frequency content  
[Irrational Numbers](output/samples/_1d/irrational_numbers/page.md) - Multiply an irrational number by the squence index and take that mod 1 to make it be in [0,1)  
[LDS](output/samples/_1d/lds/page.md) - Low discrepancy sequences  
[Regular](output/samples/_1d/regular/page.md) - Uniformly spaced samples  
[Uniform Random](output/samples/_1d/uniform_random/page.md) - Randomized sample positions using a uniform random number distribution.  
## Tests

### _1d

[Discrepancy](output/tests/_1d/discrepancy/page.md) - Calculate metrics about actual point density compared to expected point density if the points were uniformly spaced.  
[Integration](output/tests/_1d/integration/page.md) - Use sample points to integrate 1d functions  
[Numberline](output/tests/_1d/numberline/page.md) - Makes numberlines

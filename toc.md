## _1d Samples

 * [Blue Noise](output/_1d/samples/blue_noise/page.md) - Randomized sequences that have only high frequency content  
 * [Irrational Numbers](output/_1d/samples/irrational_numbers/page.md) - Multiply an irrational number by the squence index and take that mod 1 to make it be in [0,1)  
 * [LDS](output/_1d/samples/lds/page.md) - Low discrepancy sequences  
 * [Regular](output/_1d/samples/regular/page.md) - Uniformly spaced samples  
 * [Uniform Random](output/_1d/samples/uniform_random/page.md) - Randomized sample positions using a uniform random number distribution.  
## _1d Tests

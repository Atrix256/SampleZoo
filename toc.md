## Samples

### _1d

[Blue Noise](src/samples/_1d/blue_noise/samples.md) - Randomized sequences that have only high frequency content  
[Irrational Numbers](src/samples/_1d/irrational_numbers/samples.md) - Multiply an irrational number by the squence index and take that mod 1 to make it be in [0,1)  
[LDS](src/samples/_1d/LDS/samples.md) - Low discrepancy sequences  
[Regular](src/samples/_1d/regular/samples.md) - Uniformly spaced samples  
[Uniform Random](src/samples/_1d/uniform_random/samples.md) - Randomized sample positions using a uniform random number distribution.  
## Tests

[Discrepancy](src/tests/_1d/discrepancy/tests.md) - Calculate metrics about actual point density compared to expected point density if the points were uniformly spaced.  
[Numberline](src/tests/_1d/numberline/tests.md) - Makes numberlines
